Please note that this is **NOT** an official Microsoft repository, does **NOT** host any Microsoft source code, and has **NO** commercial ties to Microsoft. It is merely a quick solution **provided by the community** for installing the store on LTSC. The license is only for the deployment script itself and does **NOT** apply to any official Microsoft programs. If you believe your rights have been infringed, please contact the repository owner or open an issue, and I will respond to your concerns actively.

- Windows 11 LTSC 2024 (Tested)

**Update: It was found that the recent LTSC 2019 no longer supports the new version of the Microsoft Store. The store will ask you to update the system before use, and applications can't be installed normally. Therefore, Microsoft Store is no longer usable on LTSC 2019. If you have already installed it, you can uninstall it using [Uninstall.bat](./Uninstall.bat).**

You can just download the release and double click to install.

For compatibility reasons, the latest version of the packages is not used, for better experience you may need to update the Microsoft Store in its settings after you successfully installed it.
